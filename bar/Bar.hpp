/* 
 * InWM Bar - Single-Window Window Manager Bar
 * 
 * The only bar that you need. It shows the title of the currently focused window,
 * menu items, task switcher, and system tray. The system tray is slightly different
 * than traditional "Windows" system tray. Because the Bar itself is just a title bar
 * menu and task switcher, we need to put the network manager, volume control, time
 * etc somewhere, and that's the system tray.
